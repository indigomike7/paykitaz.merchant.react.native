## Ajv v7 beta is released

[Ajv version 7.0.0-beta.0](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tree/v7-beta) is released with these changes:

- to reduce the mistakes in JSON schemas and unexpected validation results, [strict mode](./docs/strict-mode.md) is added - it prohibits ignored or ambiguous JSON Schema elements.
- to make code injection from untrusted schemas impossible, [code generation](./docs/codegen.md) is fully re-written to be safe.
- to simplify Ajv extensions, the new keyword API that is used by pre-defined keywords is available to user-defined keywords - it is much easier to define any keywords now, especially with subschemas.
- schemas are compiled to ES6 code (ES5 code generation is supported with an option).
- to improve reliability and maintainability the code is migrated to TypeScript.

**Please note**:

- the support for JSON-Schema draft-04 is removed - if you have schemas using "id" attributes you have to replace them with "\$id" (or continue using version 6 that will be supported until 02/28/2021).
- all formats are separated to ajv-formats package - they have to be explicitely added if you use them.

See [release notes](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.0) for the details.

To install the new version:

```bash
npm install ajv@beta
```

See [Getting started with v7](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tree/v7-beta#usage) for code example.


## Mozilla MOSS grant and OpenJS Foundation

Ajv has been awarded a grant from Mozilla’s [Open Source Support (MOSS) program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) in the “Foundational Technology” track! It will sponsor the development of Ajv support of [JSON Schema version 2019-09](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-02) and of [JSON Type Definition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ucarion-json-type-definition-04).

Ajv also joined [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) – having this support will help ensure the longevity and stability of Ajv for all its users.

This [blog post](https://www.poberezkin.com/posts/2020-08-14-ajv-json-validator-mozilla-open-source-grant-openjs-foundation.html) has more details.

I am looking for the long term maintainers of Ajv – working with [ReadySet](https://www.thereadyset.co/), also sponsored by Mozilla, to establish clear guidelines for the role of a "maintainer" and the contribution standards, and to encourage a wider, more inclusive, contribution from the community.


## Please [sponsor Ajv development](https://github.com/sponsors/epoberezkin)

Since I asked to support Ajv development 40 people and 6 organizations contributed via GitHub and OpenCollective - this support helped receiving the MOSS grant!

Your continuing support is very important - the funds will be used to develop and maintain Ajv once the next major version is released.

Please sponsor Ajv via:
- [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/epoberezkin) (GitHub will match it)
- [Ajv Open Collective️](https://opencollective.com/ajv)

Thank you.

## Using version 6

[JSON Schema draft-07](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html) is published.

[Ajv version 6.0.0](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.0.0) that supports draft-07 is released. It may require either migrating your schemas or updating your code (to continue using draft-04 and v5 schemas, draft-06 schemas will be supported without changes).

__Please note__: To use Ajv with draft-06 schemas you need to explicitly add the meta-schema to the validator instance:

```javascript
ajv.addMetaSchema(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-draft-06.json'));
```

To use Ajv with draft-04 schemas in addition to explicitly adding meta-schema you also need to use option schemaId:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({schemaId: 'id'});
// If you want to use both draft-04 and draft-06/07 schemas:
// var ajv = new Ajv({schemaId: 'auto'});
ajv.addMetaSchema(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-draft-04.json'));
```

## Performance

Ajv generates code using [doT templates](https://github.com/olado/doT) to turn JSON Schemas into super-fast validation functions that are efficient for v8 optimization.

Currently Ajv is the fastest and the most standard compliant validator according to these benchmarks:

- [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark) - 50% faster than the second place
- [jsck benchmark](https://github.com/pandastrike/jsck#benchmarks) - 20-190% faster
- [z-schema benchmark](https://rawgit.com/zaggino/z-schema/master/benchmark/results.html)
- [themis benchmark](https://cdn.rawgit.com/playlyfe/themis/master/benchmark/results.html)

## Install

```
npm install ajv
```


## <a name="usage"></a>Getting started

Try it in the Node.js REPL: https://tonicdev.com/npm/ajv


The fastest validation call:

```javascript
// Node.js require:
var Ajv = require('ajv');
// or ESM/TypeScript import
import Ajv from 'ajv';

var ajv = new Ajv(); // options can be passed, e.g. {allErrors: true}
var validate = ajv.compile(schema);
var valid = validate(data);
if (!valid) console.log(validate.errors);
```

or with less code

```javascript
// ...
var valid = ajv.validate(schema, data);
if (!valid) console.log(ajv.errors);
// ...
```

or

```javascript
// ...
var valid = ajv.addSchema(schema, 'mySchema')
               .validate('mySchema', data);
if (!valid) console.log(ajv.errorsText());
// ...
```

See [API](#api) and [Options](#options) for more details.

Ajv compiles schemas to functions and caches them in all cases (using schema serialized with [fast-json-stable-stringify](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify) or a custom function as a key), so that the next time the same schema is used (not necessarily the same object instance) it won't be compiled again.

The best performance is achieved when using compiled functions returned by `compile` or `getSchema` methods (there is no additional function call).

__Please note__: every time a validation function or `ajv.validate` are called `errors` property is overwritten. You need to copy `errors` array reference to another variable if you want to use it later (e.g., in the callback). See [Validation errors](#validation-errors)

__Note for TypeScript users__: `ajv` provides its own TypeScript declarations
out of the box, so you don't need to install the deprecated `@types/ajv`
module.


## Using in browser

You can require Ajv directly from the code you browserify - in this case Ajv will be a part of your bundle.

If you need to use Ajv in several bundles you can create a separate UMD bundle using `npm run bundle` script (thanks to [siddo420](https://github.com/siddo420)).

Then you need to load Ajv in the browser:
```html
<script src="ajv.min.js"></script>
```

This bundle can be used with different module systems; it creates global `Ajv` if no module system is found.

The browser bundle is available on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/ajv).

Ajv is tested with these browsers:

[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/epoberezkin.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/epoberezkin)

__Please note__: some frameworks, e.g. Dojo, may redefine global require in such way that is not compatible with CommonJS module format. In such case Ajv bundle has to be loaded before the framework and then you can use global Ajv (see issue [#234](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/234)).


### Ajv and Content Security Policies (CSP)

If you're using Ajv to compile a schema (the typical use) in a browser document that is loaded with a Content Security Policy (CSP), that policy will require a `script-src` directive that includes the value `'unsafe-eval'`.
:warning: NOTE, however, that `unsafe-eval` is NOT recommended in a secure CSP[[1]](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy#relaxing-eval), as it has the potential to open the document to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

In order to make use of Ajv without easing your CSP, you can [pre-compile a schema using the CLI](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli#compile-schemas). This will transpile the schema JSON into a JavaScript file that exports a `validate` function that works simlarly to a schema compiled at runtime.

Note that pre-compilation of schemas is performed using [ajv-pack](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack) and there are [some limitations to the schema features it can compile](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack#limitations). A successfully pre-compiled schema is equivalent to the same schema compiled at runtime.
